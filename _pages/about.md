I am a PhD student in Industrial & systems engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST).
I am advised by Dr. Jinkyoo Park in the Systems Intelligence Laboratory.

My research focuses on ``modeling and decision-making of dynamic networked systems via
graph neural networks (GNN) and reinforcement learning (RL).''
